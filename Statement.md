# 📄 **Statement of the Project – Movie Ticket Booking System**

## 🎬 **Project Title:**  
**Movie Ticket Booking System (Python CLI Application)**

---

## 📘 **Objective of the Project**

The objective of this project is to build a simple and interactive **command-line based Movie Ticket Booking System** using Python.  
The system allows the user to view available films, book tickets, track seat availability, check their bookings, and generate a final bill.

The project demonstrates:
- Use of **functions**  
- Manipulation of **dictionaries**  
- **Input validation**  
- **Loop-based menus**  
- Basic **billing calculations**

## 🧩 **Project Description**

This Python program simulates a small movie ticket counter.  
Users interact through a menu-driven system that provides the following functionalities:

### ✔️ **1. Display Available Films**  
Shows a list of movies along with their ticket prices and film numbers.

### ✔️ **2. Book Tickets**  
Allows the user to:
- Select a movie  
- View seat availability  
- Enter how many tickets they want to book  
- Checks for invalid inputs (e.g., insufficient seats)  
- Updates remaining seats  

### ✔️ **3. View Bookings**  
Displays all the tickets the user has booked so far.

### ✔️ **4. Generate Bill**  
Calculates:
- Total ticket cost  
- Adds GST (5%)  
- Displays a properly formatted bill  

### ✔️ **5. Exit the System**  
Cleanly exits with a thank-you message.

## 🏗️ **Technical Concepts Used**

### 🔹 **Python Dictionaries**  
Used to store:
- Movie names  
- Seat availability  
- User bookings  

### 🔹 **Functions**  
Each task is separated into functions such as:
- `show_films()`  
- `book_ticket()`  
- `view_bookings()`  
- `bill()`  
- `header()`  

This improves modularity and readability.

### 🔹 **Loops & Conditionals**  
A `while True` loop maintains the menu until the user exits.  
Input validation prevents errors and incorrect entries.

## 📝 **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to create an interactive booking system.  
It also highlights important programming practices such as modular design, user input validation, and data handling using dictionaries.

The Movie Ticket Booking System is simple yet effective for learning how to create real-world console applications.
